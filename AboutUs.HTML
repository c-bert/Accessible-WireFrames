            <h2 class="text-center">The Holy Grail</h2>
            <p>There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess all right, but no Messiah. Now go away! Well, I think I should
                point out first, Brian, in all fairness, we are not, in fact, the rescue committee. However, I have been
                asked to read the following prepare statement on behalf of the movement. "We the People's Front of
                Judea,
                brackets, officials, end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings to you,
                Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom."</p>
            <p>Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an a priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the
                categorical imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx claims
                it
                was offside. We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest
                quality
                spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk
                chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose. Hey! Your nose is going to be three foot wide
                across
                your face by the time I'm finished with you! That's what being a Protestant's all about. That's why it's
                the
                church for me. That's why it's the church for anyone who respects the individual and the individual's
                right
                to decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther nailed his protest up to the church door in
                fifteen-seventeen, he may not have realised the full significance of what he was doing, but four hundred
                years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear whatever I want on my John Thomas...</p>
            <p>Oh, oh, I see! Running away, eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll
                bite
                your legs off! What is the capital of Assyria? Look at them, bloody Catholics, filling the bloody world
                up
                with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed. This is boring. Let's go watch a stoning. All
                right,
                but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh
                water
                system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us? I'm Brian, and so's my wife!</p>
